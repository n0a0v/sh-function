This implementation requires a mostly C++17 compliant compiler and has been
tested with:
	* g++ 11
	* g++ 12
	* clang 15
	* MSVC 2022 (17.9.3)

CMake & binaries are setup for unit testing. Only any header in the "sh"
directory is necessary to use that function wrapper. Simply move any header to
a desired directory.

sh::function_ptr:
	* Intended to be similar to std::function_ref. A non-owning, nullable
	  function wrapper.
sh::function_ref:
	* Intended to be similar to std::function_ref. A non-owning, non-nullable
	  function wrapper.
sh::copyable_function:
	* Intended to be similar to std::copyable_function.
sh::inplace_copyable_function:
	* Intended to be similar to std::copyable_function with a configurable
	  amount of inplace storage that will not heap allocate.
sh::inplace_move_only_function:
	* Intended to be similar to std::move_only_function with a configurable
	  amount of inplace storage that will not heap allocate.
sh::move_only_function:
	* Intended to be similar to std::move_only_function.

I hope this is useful or at least interesting!
